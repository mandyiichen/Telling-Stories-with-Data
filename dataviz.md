# General Government Debt 
## Original Visualization from the website
This visualization was posted on the website, OECD, to showcase the general government debt for various countries. I chose the year of 2016 as I like the general trend of the bar graph, and I believe it showcases some interesting data. The bar graph created by the website allows a clear comparison of the government debt between various countries, as well as their relevent rank in that specific year. The length of the bar graph along with how each bar is placed next to each other allow readers to see the differences of government debt for each country immediately. However, this visuallization makes it difficult to understand the trend across different years.

## Experimental Redesign
Here I recreated a visualization using the same general government debt data. This exercise was mainly to help me explore the Flourish Studio tool. This
I chose this specific color because I want the visualization to symbolizes gold. But I also made sure the color is dark enough for readers to see and understand the data clearly. 

Rather than comparing the relative government debt with different countries, this visualization splits each country up as an individual graph and focuses on the trend of government debt over the years.
