# Data Visualization Exercise 1: General Government Debt
## Original Visualization from the website
This visualization was posted on the website, OECD, to showcase the general government debt for various countries. I chose the year of 2016 as I like the general trend of the bar graph, and I believe it showcases some interesting data. The bar graph created by the website allows a clear comparison of the government debt between various countries, as well as their relevent rank in that specific year. The length of the bar graph along with how each bar is placed next to each other allow readers to see the differences of government debt for each country immediately. However, this visuallization makes it difficult to understand the trend across different years as it only shows the data for Year 2016.

## Experimental Redesign 1
Here I recreated a grid line charts visualization using the same general government debt data. This exercise was mainly to help me explore the Flourish Studio tool. This visualization serves a different purpose from the original one, where rather than comparing the relative government debt with different countries, it splits each country up as an individual graph and focuses on the trend of government debt over the years. This visualization can be useful when people want to understand how a specific country's government debt is changing over the years. However, as each country is presented with its own grid of line chart, shown in the graph below, it is difficult to compare each country's government debt in relation to other countries.

## Experimental Redesign 2
I created 

This visualization illustrates the range of government debt for by countries. Similar to the original bar graph from the website, this chart includes 

I deliberately made all of the lines the same color to avoid the overwhelming rainbow effect. The color gold is used to symbolize the money "gold", but I also made sure such color is dark enough for readers to see and understand the data clearly. Furthermore, I included gridlines for both x- and y-axis hoping to ensure easy tracking of each line.
