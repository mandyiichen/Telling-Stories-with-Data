This is the link to the original data visualization. I chose a data visualization under the topic of Cancer because of its important ... it provides. As Cancer is one of the major cause of death, it is crucial for the general public to understand its deadliness in order to raise awareness. Therefore, having effective data visualizations to represent cancer data not only allow people to help communicate valuable information better, but also to make people more interested in understanding about Cancer better.
The reason I picked this particular data visualization to critique and redesign is that although it showcases valuable data information, it has areas that can be improved, and are more importantly, within my ability.

## Critique Process
After I took some time to look at and understand the data visualization, I began to evaluate its pros and cons as well as the changes I would make to improve the data visualization.
I think the type of visualization works well for representing the data. The use of bar graphs clearly illustrates the differences between each race/ethnicity, which is the purpose of the visualization. Furthermore, it doesn’t have overwhelming data, illustrations, and colors that will distract readers from the core data. Due to the topic's purpose and objective, I have identified the type of visualization to be declarative and data-driven. So its features should have clear data point, be informative, and contains factual information. Therefore, I think the original bar graph is an effective graph type in this scenario.

However, there are several areas that the data visualization needs improvement on. First of all, I don’t like how the data visualization has two separate graphs. Although there are data values included to show the differences between male and female, it is difficult to compare each category’s differences between the two sexes. Instead of creating two graphs, I would combine them into one bar graph, but with each category has two sub-bars, one for male and one for female. Placing them right next to each other allows readers to directly compare and see how big of a gap/difference is between the two sexes. 

I would also change the color of the graph to better represent each sex. Instead of using the color orange, utilizing colors that commonly represent sex (blue as male and pink as female) can allow readers to identify the which sex the bar graph is representing immediately. Having two colors also helps readers to better differentiate data groups. 

Another adjustment that I would like was more of a personal preference. For me, it is easier to read and analyze a graph when the categories are on the x-axis instead of on the y-axis, which is what the original visualization has. Furthermore, because the other three graphs on the website all have bar graphs showing vertically, having only one visualization with bar graphs displaying horizontally makes the overall representation inconsistent. 

## Wireframe
After I have gained a better understanding of what parts of the data visualization needs to be redesigned, I wireframed a solution that combines everything I have mentioned in my critique.

With this wireframe, I wanted to emphasize the differences between male and female, which is something that the original data visualization failes to illustrates clearly. Furthermore, I wanted readers to be able to grasp the
