# Critique by Design: Rate of Cancer Deaths by Sex and Race/Ethnicity
## Original Data Visualization

This is the link to the original data visualization. I chose a data visualization under the topic of Cancer because of its important as Cancer is one of the major cause of death, it is crucial for the general public to understand its deadliness in order to raise awareness. Therefore, having effective data visualizations to represent cancer data not only allow people to help communicate valuable information better, but also to make people more interested in understanding about Cancer better.
The reason I picked this particular data visualization to critique and redesign is that although it showcases valuable data information, it has areas that can be improved, and are more importantly, within my ability.

## Critique Process
After I took some time to look at and understand the data visualization, I began to evaluate its pros and cons as well as the changes I would make to improve the data visualization.
I think the type of visualization works well for representing the data. The use of bar graphs clearly illustrates the differences between each race/ethnicity, which is the purpose of the visualization. Furthermore, it doesn’t have overwhelming data, illustrations, and colors that will distract readers from the core data. Due to the topic's purpose and objective, I have identified the type of visualization to be declarative and data-driven. So its features should have clear data point, be informative, and contains factual information. Therefore, I think the original bar graph is an effective graph type in this scenario.

However, there are several areas that the data visualization needs improvement on. First of all, I don’t like how the data visualization has two separate graphs. Although there are data values included to show the differences between male and female, it is difficult to compare each category’s differences between the two sexes. Instead of creating two graphs, I would combine them into one bar graph, but with each category has two sub-bars, one for male and one for female. Placing them right next to each other allows readers to directly compare and see how big of a gap/difference is between the two sexes. 

I would also change the color of the graph to better represent each sex. Instead of using the color orange, utilizing colors that commonly represent sex (blue as male and pink as female) can allow readers to identify the which sex the bar graph is representing immediately. Having two colors also helps readers to better differentiate data groups. 

Another adjustment that I would like was more of a personal preference. For me, it is easier to read and analyze a graph when the categories are on the x-axis instead of on the y-axis, which is what the original visualization has. Furthermore, because the other three graphs on the website all have bar graphs showing vertically, having only one visualization with bar graphs displaying horizontally makes the overall representation inconsistent. 

## Wireframe
After I have gained a better understanding of what parts of the data visualization needs to be redesigned, I wireframed a solution that combines everything I have mentioned in my critique.

As shown in the image above, I changed the original color orange to blue representing the male category and pink representing the female category. I also switched the composition of the graph to correspond with the other data visualizations on the same webpage. So the race/ethnicity category that was originally placed on the y-axis is now on the x-axis, and the rate of cancer death is now on the y-axis. Lastly, I merged the male and female graphs into one synchronized graph by placing same category right next to each other.

With this wireframe, I wanted to emphasize the differences between male and female, which is something that the original data visualization failes to illustrates clearly. Furthermore, I wanted readers to be able to grasp the concept faster with my redesigned data visualization as I believe it is clearer, more concise, and better aesthetically looking.

## Test the Solution
After I created the wireframe, I showed it to my family members and asked them the several questions to test if other people can understand my redeisgned data visualization easily. I recorded their answers in the following:

Can you tell me what you think this is? What it is telling you?
* It’s a graph that shows how different races and sexes have different rate of cancer deaths. It tells me that male is more likely to die from cancer for all races.
* It’s showing the differeces in cancer death rates among various races and sexes. It's telling me that there are differences between them, with Black having the highest cancer death rate and Asian and Pacific Islander have the lowest cancer death rate. 

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
* Female has lower rate of cancer deaths across all races, which makes me wonder the reasons behind such results. 
* I am surprised that the differences between races is this significant. I’ve never really thought that people with certain races have higher chances of dying from Cancer. I wonder if it has more to do with nature or nurture. If it’s the genetic composition, or the environment, habits, and medical care. 

Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
* I think it’s pretty much for all the adults, as the graph is quite simple and easy to understand. 
* I think it’s intended for those with interests in Cancer. Either people who are generally wanting to know more about the deadliness of Cancer, or those who want to understand their chances of dying from Cancer.

Is there anything you would change or do differently?
* I think it’s a pretty good graph that shows clear data using easily understandable visualizations.
* If possible, I would maybe add something that can show the average across all races to understand if the data is above or below the average. Because right now I can only compare relatively with other races, but cannot compare to something overall. 


## Final Design
![Edited Wireframe](/sketch2.jpg)

Based on the suggestions from the feedbacks I received, I added the average rate of cancer death for both male and female for all races/ethnicities to allow readers have a better basis of the data. It also further minimizes the needs for an additional graph to showcase averages, which is shown as the first graph in the original website.

Once I finalized my new design, I created my final data visualization using flourish and included everything that I have adjusted. For the newly added dashed lines, I included their data value on the graph since the dashed lines are not interactive, and therefore cannot show the exact value when the cursor is placed on it. I used dashed lines to represent the average value because I don't want to overemphasize them and I don't want the lines to cover the bar graphs. Lastly, I made the dashed lines color correspond with the bar graphs to help readers to identify which set of bar graphs the dashed line is relating to.
