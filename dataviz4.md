# Part II

## Additional Information from Part I:
As I received the feedback that I should emphasize my call to action clearer and better for Part I Assignment, I have listed out my call to actions below.

Call to action:
1.	Self-monitor yourself when you interact with others online. Make sure you do not accidently become the bully. 
2.	Learn and teach your friends/family members/colleagues appropriate online behaviors to create a more friendly online environment.
3.	Report cyberbullying behaviors such as negative comments, false rumors, and threats to platforms. This will help websites regulate negative user behaviors.
4.	Practice self-care and self-love. Remember, you are not what others say you are. Don’t let someone else determine your worth!

## Wireframes:
I have created my story outline and relevant components using wireframes. I have included:
* Description of the type of information I will include in each slide.
* Titles and headlines.
* Data visualizations to support the statement.
* Background images to enhance the overall visualization.
* Layout of each slides. 
I have also adjusted the structure of the project a little after I continued to develop my story outline as I believe the newly adjusted outline makes the story flow better. For example, I moved the data visualization showing the increased incidents of cyberbullying over the years from the conflict section (around the middle part of my story) to the setup. This is because I believe it is crucial for the audience to understand the severity of cyberbullying early on, and that such visualization supports the conclusion of an increase in frequency of cyberbullying from the previous slide.

## User research:
### Target audience:
The target audience is the general public all over the world since this topic is a global issue. However, I want to target specifically on the following types of audience as I believe they are either more susceptible to cyberbullying or more likely to care about this topic.

Teenagers and young adults (age 12-20): This group of people tend to spend a lot of time on social media. They are constantly on social media sharing their lives, chatting with friends, and even for making a living. Therefore, they are most susceptible to cyberbullying, and should really understand how to prevent cyberbullying.

Parents: Many parents are concerned about their children becoming victims of cyberbullying. Therefore, they need help and knowledge on how to protect their children from cyberbullying. 


### Identify representative individuals to interview:
I conducted my user interview with people that all fit into my target audience. One of them is a parent of three, the second person is a 20-year-old teenage boy, and the last person is a 13-year-old teenage girl. The reason why I chose to interview people that match my target audience is that I can better understand what my target audience might think and react to my story. Receiving comments and feedbacks from them can help me better tailor my story towards my target audience.

### Interview Script:
* Can you describe what the story is trying to convey?
* Who do you think is the target audience? 
* Is there anything confusing or needs improvement on?
* Do the visualizations support my purpose effectively? If not, how can I improve?
* Is the overall story attention-grabbing? Is it interesting throughout?
* Is there anything you wish to be included or have additional information in the story?

### Findings from the interviews:
* Can you describe what the story is trying to convey?

Everyone was able to describe that the main purpose is to stop cyberbullying. I was also glad that they were all able to point out most of the sub-sections’ conclusions, such as how the increased usage of internet results in increased incidents of cyberbullying, cyberbullying has various negative effects on the victims. 

* Who do you think is the target audience? 

Interviewee 1: Internet users, students.

Interviewee 2: Parents, teenagers, and teachers. 

Interviewee 3: General public, teenagers.
* Confusing areas and recommendations to improve:
1.	One interviewee found the slide with the question “Why should I care about cyberbullying?” doesn’t really reflect the next data visualization. The next slide is talking about the effects of the victims, but not everyone is a victim. So she suggests to move the slide that talks about negative effects of cyberbullying forward to the beginning, where I explain what is cyberbullying instead. This will help the audience gain a better understanding of what cyberbullying can do to people.
2.	Another interviewee finds the transition into talking about social media a little random. He recommends to start off with something like “what causes the increase of cyberbullying?” to better integrate it into the story.

* Visualizations:
1.	Include percentages on the movable pie graph, so the audience can see the difference when the pie graph too subtle to visualize.
2.	The symbol # makes the presentation a little less formal. So if it’s a serious topic, maybe consider using words instead.
3.	Some words are capitalized while some are not. So make sure to keep everything consistent.


* Is the overall story attention-grabbing? Is it interesting throughout?
1.	It’s interesting enough for me to continue to read. But I would recommend having image backgrounds for all slides.
2.	I personally don’t have a lot of interest in informative websites, statistics, and the topic of cyberbullying itself. But I think its interesting enough given its category.
3.	It’s quite interesting because the graphs are quite different and I actually learned something I didn’t before.

* Is there anything you wish to be included or have additional information in the story?
1.	I think your call to actions should also include helping those who are already affected by cyberbullying. The last recommendation seems a little unnecessary, so maybe change it to “seek professional help”.
2.	Identify behaviors that consider as cyberbullying. Some people might be unaware that they are cyberbullying others.
3.	For the call to actions section, although you talked about self-monitoring as well as teaching others proper online behaviors, but you didn’t really touch upon that. So you can include additional information on appropriate online behaviors.

## Changes to implement:
Based on the results from my user research, I will implement the following changes to my wireframes:
1.	Move the question “Why should I care about cyberbullying?” to before I begin describing how cyberbullying is increasing over the years. Having the question towards the beginning will help the audience better understand that cyberbullying is a serious matter and that they should care about it. Also, such question is a good introduction that leads into talking about how cyberbullying is a global issue that can potentially affect everyone.
2.	Move the slide that talks about negative effects of cyberbullying forward to the beginning, where I explain what is cyberbullying instead. This will help the audience gain a better understanding of what cyberbullying can do to people.
3.	Add a question “what causes the increase of cyberbullying?” before I go into talking about the rise of social media to better explain why I am including social media into the story.
4.	Change the fourth call to action to address victims that are already affected by cyberbullying, such as seek professional help. This will ensure I am addressing to a broader range of audience and that I am not excluding anyone.
5.	Identify behaviors that consider as cyberbullying at the beginning where I define cyberbullying. Including these behaviors will help the audience better determine the “don’t do” online behaviors. 
6.	Include a governmental website that explains proper online etiquettes, behaviors, as well as additional information on cyberbullying. This allows the audience to learn more about the topic after reading my story, and has access to a governmental website for future reference.
