My portfolio page for Telling Stories with Data class.

# About me
My name is Mandy Chen, and I am a first year master student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Entertainment Industry Management. I graduated from University of California San Diego with a Bachelor Degree in Biology, and worked at an oncology lab for a while before I decided that such career path was not for me. So I began my journey of self-discovery and exploring my career goals and personal values. After a few internships and listening to various people talking about their experiences, I found that I have huge interest in the Entertainment industry, especially the management area. So here I am today, learning about what I love and hope to one day have a job that allow me to be doing what I have passion for.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to analyze and interpret various types of data, as well as to gain knowledge on the definitions of good data and visualization. Furthermore, I hope to learn various tools and techniques required to create effective data, and ultimately to gain skills that will be relevent in any future settings. 
I am taking this class because with the current advancement in technologies, data is everywhere. People, organizations, and companies use data to help make sense of certain information. Therefore, the ability to know how to interpret, construct, and reconstruct data is extremely crucial and useful in almost any area. So I beleive this class will help me gain valuable skills and become comfortable around various type of data.
