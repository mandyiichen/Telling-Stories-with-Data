# Part III

## Project Summary:
1.	Chose the topic of Cyberbullying and identified call of action.
2.	Researched about the topic, including possible data.
3.	Created an outline of the story, including setup, conflict, and solution.
4.	Roughly sketched out data visualizations I would like to include in my story, along with data sources I am going to use.
5.	Decided on the method and medium I will use to complete my story, which is on shorthand.
6.	Created wireframes to outline my story.
7.	Identified target audiences for the story.
8.	Identified representative individuals I would like to conduct user research on.
9.	Created interview scripts and questions to ask interviewees.
10.	Conducted interviews.
11.	Recorded findings from the interview.
12.	Modified my wireframes based on the suggestions and findings collected from the interview.
13.	Created all of my data visualizations using flourish and infogram.
14.	Completed all of my write-up.
15.	Created the story using Shorthand platform and incorporated all of my data visualizations and write-up.

## Changes made since Part II:
* Since all of my interviewees identified my target audience successfully, I did not adjust my target audience. So I am still targeting towards teenagers and young adults (age 12-20) as they are more susceptible to cyberbullying, and parents, as they are more likely to care about this topic.
* One major adjustment I made was using more images. I took the time to find additional images that would fit with my story and included them either as background or next to the text with the hope of making the story more attractive to teenagers.
* Like I mentioned in the last part of part II, I switched some of the order around so that the story can flow more naturally and better.
* I changed the type of visualization for the effects of cyberbullying from the originally planned bar graphs to packed circles. One of the reasons for such change is that I want to have more variety on the type of data visualizations, so the audience will not get bored by repetitive visualizations. Another reason is that I don’t really need the audience to know the exact percentage of each type of effects. Instead, my purpose is to illustrate there are multiple effects. Therefore, I believe that packed circles can illustrate my purpose effectively without overwhelming the audience with numbers.
* In addition to using flourish, I also used the website, infogram, to create some of the data visualizations. The reason I decided to use infogram was that such website allowed me to create more variety on the type of data visualizations. For example, instead of creating regular bar graphs for the psychological impacts of cyberbullying, I used pictorial bar from infogram to help with the visualization. 


## Reflections:
* One major thing I learned from this project is the importance of having clear outline and wireframes beforehand. Detailed wireframes helped organize my thoughts very orderly. I was able to follow my wireframes when creating the story on shorthand easily, as I know exactly where each data visualization goes, and which information goes with what visualization. I will make sure to always create wireframes for all of my future projects.
* Another major takeaway I got from this project is to always test your story/project with other people, preferably those that resemble your target audience. I was able to receive a lot of valuable suggestions from the interviews and was able to get a general understanding of how well I addressed my story to my target audience.
* The most difficult part of the project was deciding which type of data visualization to represent the data. I would often be torn between two different types of data visualizations, unsure which would better represent the data.
